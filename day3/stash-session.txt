 so the stash workflow(how i have practiced it) goes like this :

 i was on main branch, i created a demo branch 
 i made some changes to the main branch's file and pushed it to remote 
 i came back to demo branch and made changes to some file 
 now i stashed my work in demo and pulled the code from main 
 then i did stash apply to get back my unfinished work 
 i got some merge conflicts that i resolved and kept both the changes as the changes were done to the same file
